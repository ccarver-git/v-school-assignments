        <p>This past summer in August I sat down with Michael Jordan at his county club in Park City after he finished a round of golf. We had this interview scheduled months and months ago. He was honest, candid and humble and warm. After chatting about our fmailies and other small talk we grabbed a bit to eat. After lunch we jumped into talking about him selling a portion of his basketball team, The Hornets, and other business ventures he paused for what seemed like an eternity. He then, with my hinting, brought up the famous "push off". Mr Jordan, for the first time in nearly twenty years admitted he push Bryan Russell to the side as he hit a game winning shot that ultimatly propelled his Bulls to a championship. I was in shocked. I looked over at my producer for any guidedance. He just shrugged his shoulders in confusion along with a blank stare. I finally chimed in and asked, Why now? Why come forward after all this time. You will not beleie what he said next. After a some context and background he proceeded to tell me he was visited by a small blue tiny what he referred to as a Smurf.</p>
