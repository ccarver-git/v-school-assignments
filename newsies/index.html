        <p class="come-clean" style="display: inline-block">It took nearly twenty years but Michael Jordan has come clean.</p>
        <p>I sat down with Jordan at a local county club in Park City after he finished a round of golf. He want honest, candid and humble. After talking about selling a portion of his Hornets, and other business ventures he paused for what seemed like an eternity. He brought up the famous push off. Jordan, for the first time in nearly twenty years admitted he push Bryan Russell to the side as he hit a game winning shot that ultimatly propelled his Bulls to a championship.</p>
