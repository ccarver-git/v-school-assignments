        <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
        <p>
          Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
          browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and
          abandoned browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
          achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP,
          and the major browser creators.

          The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
          lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
          time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one
          with the web.

        <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
        <p>
          There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden
          aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view
          some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will
          load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same,
          the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
          document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets
          people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
          reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
          structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty
          of the web; we can always push it further.
