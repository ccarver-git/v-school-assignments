    <h4>Jordan Comes Clean</h6>
        <p>It took nearly twenty years but <span class="special">Michael Jordan</span> has come clean.</p>
        <p>I sat down with Jordan at a local county club in Park City after he finished a round of golf. He want honest, candid and humble. After talking about selling a portion of his Hornets, and other business ventures he paused for what seemed like an eternity. He brought up the famous <mark>push off</mark>. Jordan, for the first time in nearly twenty years admitted he push Bryan Russell to the side as he hit a game winning shot that ultimatly propelled his Bulls to a championship.</p>
